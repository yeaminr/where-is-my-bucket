Script to find AWS S3 Bucket

When our organisation has multiple AWS accounts, every now and then we are in a situation where we need to find out which AWS account a specific S3 bucket belongs to. Sometimes, we may wonder which Route53 zone holds the DNS record for a specific domain. Tried to automate that searching effort, not fast enough though, but it at least can relieve us from the grind to login to each account's console and check.
